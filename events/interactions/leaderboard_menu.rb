# ==========================================
# EVENT: Leaderboard Navigation
# DESCRIPTION: Listens for category selections on the /leaderboard command.
#
# Defensive design: every Discord API call here is wrapped in a rescue so
# transient interaction state errors (most commonly the 40060 "Interaction
# has already been acknowledged" — which can show up if Discord double-
# delivers an interaction, if the bot is temporarily double-running, or if
# the user fires multiple clicks in quick succession) do NOT bubble up as
# unhandled exceptions. The user-facing UX still works because edit_response
# uses the webhook channel and remains valid even when the initial ack was
# already taken by a prior call.

  # fine — edit_response below will still work as a webhook follow-up.
