## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Smart global slash sync:** On ready, Blossom GETs Discord’s global commands and bulk-overwrites **only when** the normalized schema differs from `slash_definitions.rb` (or always when `BLOSSOM_SLASH_SYNC=force`). Regenerate payloads with **`ruby components/_gen_slash_definitions.rb`** after editing the **`slash_registry.rb`** `=begin` block.
- **`/profile shop` / `b!profile shop`:** Premium users get a single CV2 panel listing shop pet Prisma prices (and pointers to title/theme/badge commands).
- **Instant ban on forbidden home channel:** Messages in `FORBIDDEN_INSTANT_BAN_CHANNEL_ID` are deleted and the author is banned; bots and `DEV_IDS` are exempt from the ban (see `events/passive/0_forbidden_channel_instant_ban.rb`).

### Documentation

- **Premium perks & Ko-fi ops:** Expanded **`COMMANDS.md`** perks table (arcade, scratch Double or Nothing, chat XP, trivia, boss, heist, birthdays, leaderboard flair, etc.). Documented explicit **Path A** (Discord roles via Ko‑fi rewards) vs **Path B** (`POST /webhooks/kofi`): Path B verifies/dedupes and runs **`grant_premium_roles_after_kofi`** (**`PREMIUM_SERVERS`**) when payloads include a Discord snowflake — **automatic role removal when membership ends** remains primarily **[Ko‑fi Discord rewards](https://help.ko-fi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020363857-Setting-up-Discord-rewards-with-Ko-fi)** (Ko‑fi does not webhook cancel today). **`README.md`** lays out reverse-proxy **URL → `127.0.0.1:<port>`**, shared **`TOPGG_WEBHOOK_*`** bind/port, and env (**`KOFI_VERIFICATION_TOKEN`**, **`KOFI_MEMBERSHIP_WEBHOOK_TYPES`**, **`KOFI_PAGE_URL`**) plus **`https://ko-fi.com/manage/webhooks`**.
- **Pity wording (historical):** Corrected **`[v1.0.0]`** Premium / gacha changelog lines to match code—pity counts pulls **below** Legendary/Goddess (Rare counts toward the counter).

### Fixed

- **`/invest` / portfolio reads / withdraw:** `get_investment` no longer calls `Time.parse` on a value the `pg` gem already decodes as `Time` (which raised and broke invest flows). Investing now uses a single DB transaction (check open position, atomic coin deduction, insert) so races cannot spend coins without creating the row. **`withdraw_investment_atomic`** does SELECT … FOR UPDATE, payout math (aligned with `calculate_investment_value`), DELETE, and coin credit in one transaction so deletes and payouts cannot diverge. **`BlossomCache`** adds `sweep_expired!`, invoked from the weekly-challenge background loop, so expired TTL entries are pruned instead of sitting in `@store` until that key is read again.
- **Profile Prisma cosmetics:** Shop pets, titles, themes, and purchasable badges now debit Prisma with a single **`UPDATE … WHERE balance >= cost`** (`deduct_prisma!`) so a failed payment cannot still apply the cosmetic; negative `add_prisma` no longer creates a bad first row for users without a **`user_prisma`** record. **Custom banner** uses the same atomic debit. Prefix **`b!profile`** normalizes empty first args to **view**; **`b!profile shop`** (and **`/profile shop`**) lists shop pet prices and commands. Slash handlers read options with string or symbol keys.
- **Heist console noise:** The hourly heist loop and result runner no longer **`puts`** routine heist diagnostics to the terminal.
- **`b!say` multiline:** The command no longer flattens your announcement into one line — it parses the raw message after `#channel` so **newlines and paragraph spacing** survive into the embed. PostgreSQL **`NOTICE`** lines from idempotent DDL (`CREATE … IF NOT EXISTS`, `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`) are suppressed per pooled connection via **`client_min_messages = WARNING`**. **`purge_user_data`** deletes Ko-fi rows with **`discord_user_id`** (not **`user_id`**), uses **`SAVEPOINT`** per table so one failure no longer aborts the whole transaction, and no longer prints **`[PURGE]`** skip / failure lines on every boot.
- **`b!dserver` DM list includes guild snowflakes** next to each name (sorted A→Z, still chunked for Discord limits).
- **Hourly heist announcements:** unknown/missing channels no longer spam multi-line stack traces — discordrb’s duplicate **Unknown Channel** log line is filtered like **Unknown Member**; the loop **clears** a dead `heist_channel` from `server_configs` so you can run **`heist setup`** again in a valid channel. Misconfigured channels stay registered until an admin fixes overrides or picks a new channel (**NoPermission** no longer emits loop `puts`; config stays in place).
- **`b!dcommxp` no longer silently reverts.** The passive community-pool handler ran on the same message as the command, read stale totals, and could write `old_xp + chat_gain` after the dev update — mirroring the old `b!setxp` race. Prefix command messages are now skipped by the community leveling event (and blacklisted users no longer contribute pool XP), consistent with per-user leveling.
- **Global Communities leaderboard names after guild renames:** Not a Discord API delay — the tab read cached `server_name` from the database, which only refreshed on boot, community XP writes, or `dcommxp`. The embed now prefers the live guild name from Blossom’s cache when she’s in that server, and **`GUILD_UPDATE`** syncs the stored name so the DB stays current too.
- **Leaderboards (all three tabs):** Embeds use plain titles (no 👥💰 globe icons on the board). Dropdown options have no decorative emojis. Only **1st–3rd** place rows use 🏆 🥈 🥉; ranks 4+ have no rank-side medal. **Bold highlighting:** Global Communities bolds only the server you’re in when it appears; Server Members (XP) and Global Richest bold only **your** username when you’re on that list (fixes markdown noise from double-wrapping every name).
- **Monthly daily-calendar milestone payouts are atomic.** 14-/28‑claim milestone coin bonuses (premium happy-hour/stacked payouts via `calculate_coin_payout`) and the 28‑day Prisma drop for subscribers are folded into the same `commit_daily_claim_atomic` transaction as the base daily grant for both `b!daily` and premium auto-claim, instead of a second `award_coins` / `add_prisma` pass that could fail or race after the main claim was already written.
- **Fewer economy half-states across daily, transfers, shop, and ascension.** Interactive `daily`, premium auto-claim, `givecoins` peer transfers, `/buy` (black-market stacks, Goddess Prisma pulls, coin character purchases), and `/ascend` now persist related coin/prisma/inventory/collection updates in coordinated transactions (or paired helpers) instead of separate `add_coins` / `add_prisma` / row writes that could leave inconsistent balances if the process crashed mid-flight or two actions raced.
- **"Unknown Member" log spam silenced.** discordrb's API layer logs Discord error responses via `Discordrb::LOGGER.error(e.full_message)` *before* raising the exception, so callers like `is_premium?` (which already `rescue` the resulting `UnknownMember`) couldn't suppress the noise — every stale-member fetch across 1000+ users / 13+ servers still printed `[ERROR : et-NN @ ...] Unknown Member` to stdout. New helper `helpers/log_filter.rb` monkey-patches `Discordrb::Logger#error` to drop log lines matching any pattern in `SUPPRESSED_LOG_PATTERNS` (e.g. **`Unknown Member`**, **`Unknown Channel`**); the underlying exception still raises and is still caught by existing rescues. Add more substrings/regexes to that list if other low-signal Discord errors start spamming the console.
- `**b!setxp` no longer silently reverts.** The passive chat-XP handler used to fire on the command message itself, race the admin write, and overwrite it with `old_xp + chat_gain`. Command messages (anything starting with `PREFIX`) are now skipped by the leveling event entirely.
- **Trivia buttons no longer report "expired" on every click — for real this time, structurally.** The previous fix migrated session state from an in-memory hash to a `trivia_sessions` table, but click resolution still depended on that DB row being present and visible. Any race, transaction-visibility hiccup, missing migration, or stale code path would make `DB.get_trivia_session` return `nil` and the user would see "expired" the instant they clicked. The handler is now **DB-independent for the answer decision**: every piece of state needed to resolve a click — the user id, this option's label, the correct label, the reward, and the asked-at epoch — is baked into the button `custom_id` itself (format `tv2_<uid>_<label>_<correct>_<reward>_<epoch>`). The DB row is consulted purely to decorate the result message with the full correct-answer text; if it's missing, the message degrades gracefully to `(answer hidden)` instead of falsely claiming the trivia expired. The only remaining trigger for an "expired" message is the asked-epoch in the custom_id actually being older than `TRIVIA_TIME_LIMIT` seconds.
- **Trivia DB layer hardened against silent failures and timezone weirdness.** `get_trivia_session` reads `asked_at` as an epoch (`EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM asked_at)::bigint`) and rebuilds it with `Time.at`, eliminating any naive-timestamp / local-vs-UTC drift. All trivia DB methods explicitly cast `uid.to_i`, log exceptions with `[TRIVIA DB ERROR]` instead of swallowing them, and `save_trivia_session` returns true/false so callers can verify the row landed. (Diagnostic per-call logs that were added during the previous round of debugging have been removed now that the click handler no longer depends on the DB for correctness.)
- **Blacklisted users can no longer bypass the block via slash commands or button clicks.** discordrb's `ignore_user` only filters message events; slash commands, buttons, selects, and modals slipped past it. A new interaction guard checks the bot's ignore set and short-circuits with an ephemeral notice in Blossom's voice.
- **Blacklisting a user now wipes their entire footprint from the database.** Previously, a blacklisted user kept all their coins, prisma, collection, achievements, badges, materials, challenges, daily calendar, investments, social interaction counters, premium status, custom banners, trivia state, lottery entries, boss participation, crew memberships, giveaway entries, per-server XP, marriages, friendships, gift logs, and rep cooldowns — they just couldn't access any of it. Now `b!blacklist` runs a single-transaction purge across every per-user table after adding the user to the list, and the response embed shows how many rows were wiped. Removing someone from the blacklist (forgiving them) does NOT restore their data — once it's gone, it's gone.
- **Blacklisted user data is re-purged on every bot boot.** The `$bot.ready` blacklist application loop now also calls `DB.purge_user_data(uid)` for every blacklisted user, in addition to applying the in-memory ignore. This is a self-healing safety net: if anything ever leaks data back in for someone on the list (a bug, a manual SQL insert, a partial transaction), the next restart will wipe it again. The boot log prints a one-line summary of how many users were re-applied and how many stale rows were cleaned.
- **Blacklisted users no longer earn XP, levels, chat coins, or activity streaks.** The passive `$bot.message` leveling handler now bails out immediately if `event.bot.ignored?(uid)` is true. discordrb's gateway-level filter already drops most messages from ignored users, but this explicit check protects against the narrow window where a user is freshly blacklisted in the DB but the in-memory ignore set hasn't synced yet.
- **Leaderboard select-menu navigation no longer crashes on transient interaction state errors.** The handler at `events/interactions/leaderboard_menu.rb` was raising unhandled `Interaction has already been acknowledged` (Discord 40060) exceptions when `defer_update` happened to lose the race against another ack — most commonly from a double-delivered interaction, a momentarily double-running bot process, or a rapid double-click. Every Discord API call in the handler is now wrapped in a defensive rescue that logs and continues. `edit_response` still works in those cases because it goes through the webhook channel, so the user-facing behavior is unchanged on success and degrades to a logged warning instead of a raised exception on the rare failure.
- **Stale servers no longer linger on the global leaderboard or in the per-server XP table.** On every boot, after the existing server-name sync, Blossom now diffs her connected-server list against the DB and prunes any `community_levels` and `server_xp` rows for guilds she's no longer in. Includes a hard safety guard: if the connected-server cache is empty (e.g., a flaky gateway handshake), the prune is skipped entirely so a transient blip can't wipe the database. Counts of pruned rows are logged.
- **Lottery inserts are actually transactional.** `enter_lottery` used `@db.exec("BEGIN")` / separate `exec_params` / `COMMIT` on the connection pool wrapper, which can run each statement on a different pooled connection — so the BEGIN never wrapped the INSERTs. It now runs all ticket inserts inside `PGPoolWrapper#transaction` (single checked-out connection). `get_lottery_stats` no longer pulls the full lottery table into Ruby; it uses one SQL statement with aggregate subqueries.
- **Economy-facing coin deductions are concurrency-safe.** New `DatabaseEconomy#deduct_coins_if_possible`; boot migration clamps stray negative balances then adds `global_users_coins_non_negative` CHECK. Arcade (`coinflip`, `cups`, `dice`, `roulette`, `scratch`, `slots`), blackjack (per-user Mutex + atomic deduct on start/double-down), carnival ring toss/balloon pop, Double-or-Nothing loss stash, crafting (deduct coins before removing materials), `/summon` pull cost, and `/lottery` ticket purchase (`purchase_lottery_tickets` — deduction + INSERTs in one transaction) use the new path instead of SELECT-then-UPDATE gaps.

### Changed

- **Family flavor text:** **`mom_remark`** still fires **only** for **`DEV_ID`** (primary creator). Command responses now use **`family_remark`**, which adds **Uncle Z / Zin** lines (`DEV_IDS[1]`) and **Berry** (`BERRY_MOM_ID`, other mom) while keeping mama as #1 in Blossom’s bit. **`DEV_IDS`** now includes Z’s snowflake as second dev.

- **Slash command sync:** On ready, **`BlossomSlashSync`** GETs Discord’s global commands, compares a normalized fingerprint to **`BlossomSlashDefinitions`** (from `components/slash_definitions.rb`), and calls **bulk overwrite** only when they differ. **`BLOSSOM_SLASH_SYNC`**: `auto` (default), `never` (no HTTP), `force` (always PUT). Edit the `=begin` block in **`components/slash_registry.rb`**, then run **`ruby components/_gen_slash_definitions.rb`** to refresh the generated payloads. Duplicate **`/leaderboard`** and **`/vote`** registration remains removed from **`events/passive/ready.rb`**.
- **`/support` / `b!support`:** Invite updated to **https://discord.gg/cZ8zAT42u4** (Sakura Shrine).

### Added

- **`b!say #channel <text>`** (Administrator or Developer ID): posts an embed whose body is the message into another channel **in the same server**; prefix-only, 4096-char cap. **`b!drules #channel`** (Developer ID): posts Blossom's default server-rules embed (incl. staff ping etiquette).

- **Premium expansion pack:** `/vipcrate` (monthly coins + Prisma), `/eventvip` (daily event currency during seasonal months), **Subscriber Streak Guard** (weekly streak save when `/autoclaim` is on), **weekly summon stipend** (3× −40 coins) + automatic **+5 pity** once per ISO week, **×1.12** carnival ticket wins for subscribers, **+8%** crew XP from coin→crew conversion for Premium, **+12** server **community XP** on Premium boss hits, **favorite slots 4–5** with **`/collection` showcase** row, **`profile epithet`** / **`profile tagline`**, **monthly rotating pet** (half off Prisma for subs), DB table **`premium_extras`**, and related columns on **`global_users`**.

- **Neon Arcade hub account-age gate:** On the home guild (**`1499998845873033316`**), **`member_join`** kicks non-bot members whose Discord account is younger than **14 days** (`events/passive/member_logging.rb`). Documented under **`/verifysetup`** in **`COMMANDS.md`**.

- **Developer command `b!dleave <server_id>`** (prefix-only): Blossom leaves the specified guild by snowflake. Developer ID only; documented in **`COMMANDS.md`** and **`b!devhelp`**.
- **Owner hub join/leave log:** `events/passive/hub_guild_logger.rb` posts Components V2 (section + icon thumbnail) to hub channel **1500339783610929192** (guild **1499998845873033316**) on **`GUILD_CREATE`** / **`GUILD_DELETE`** with members, owner username, created time, guild id, and current arcade + member totals. Channel id in **`data/settings.rb`** as **`HUB_GUILD_LOG_CHANNEL_ID`**.

- **Top.gg voting:** WEBrick webhook listener on `POST /webhooks/topgg` (v1 `x-topgg-signature` + legacy `Authorization`), Prisma **5 + streak** (streak capped at **10**, reset after **>28h** between votes), multiplied by top.gg **weight**, idempotent `vote_id`, blacklist records vote without paying. Tables `topgg_votes_processed`, `topgg_vote_state`. Env: `TOPGG_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `TOPGG_BOT_DISCORD_ID`, optional `TOPGG_VOTE_PAGE_URL`, `TOPGG_WEBHOOK_PORT`, `TOPGG_WEBHOOK_BIND`. Commands `b!vote` / `/vote` and DM reminder loop. **Gem:** `webrick`.
- **Ko-fi membership webhook:** `POST /webhooks/kofi` mounts when **`KOFI_VERIFICATION_TOKEN`** is set. Verifies Ko-fi JSON **`verification_token`**, accepts configurable membership `type`s (comma-separated **`KOFI_MEMBERSHIP_WEBHOOK_TYPES`**, default **`Subscription`**), persists idempotent **`kofi_webhooks_processed`** rows, runs **`grant_premium_roles_after_kofi`** (**`PREMIUM_SERVERS`**) when a Discord snowflake is present on replay-safe membership receipts, clears **`CACHE`** premium keys after sync. Shares **`TOPGG_WEBHOOK_*`** bind/port with Top.gg. Listener lives in **`components/blossom_webhook_server.rb`** (**`TopggWebhookServer`** aliases **`BlossomWebhookServer`**).
- **`b!premium` / `/premium`** (`vip`, `supporter`, `subscribe`) — short Neon Arcade VIP rundown + **`KOFI_PAGE_URL`** Ko‑fi link line when configured.

- Developer commands `b!dcommxp` (aliases `dcomm`, `communityxp`) to adjust **community** (server-wide pooled) XP and level for the current guild — separate from per-user `setxp`. `add` / `remove` / `set` recalc level from cumulative XP; `level` sets rank while preserving stored XP. DB helpers `community_xp_threshold` and `community_level_from_total_xp` on `DatabaseLeveling`; passive community leveling now uses the shared threshold method.
- New DB module `DatabaseTrivia` with `get_trivia_session`, `save_trivia_session`, `mark_trivia_answered`, and `clear_trivia_session`.
- New `trivia_sessions` table (one row per user, upserted on each new question).
- New `helpers/blacklist_guard.rb` that monkey-patches `ApplicationCommandEventHandler#call` and `ComponentEventHandler#call` to enforce the blacklist on all interaction types.
- New `DB.prune_orphan_servers(active_ids)` method on `DatabaseLeveling` that cleans the global leaderboard and per-server XP tables of any server IDs not in the supplied active list (with empty-list safety guard).
- New `DB.purge_user_data(uid)` method on `DatabaseAdmin` that nukes a user's entire footprint across every per-user and pairwise-relationship table in a single transaction. Returns a `{ table_name => deleted_row_count }` hash so callers can log meaningful summaries. Per-table failures roll back to a savepoint and continue instead of aborting the whole purge.
- New developer command `b!dserver` (prefix-only, no slash variant by design) that DMs the invoking developer an alphabetically sorted, numbered list of every server Blossom is currently connected to. Output is chunked across multiple DMs to respect Discord's 2000-char limit; in-channel reply confirms the total count and number of DM chunks sent. The command is listed in `b!devhelp`.

### Changed

- **`PREMIUM_SERVERS`** (guild **`1499998845873033316`**): subscriber role id is now **`1500326377780547604`** (`helpers/economy_engine.rb`).
- **Main server auto level roles:** IDs updated for milestones 5 / 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 / 75 / 100 (`events/passive/user_leveling.rb`).
- **Weekly challenges CV2:** Decorative Unicode emoji (status icons, headers, bonus lines, claim button, completion screen) removed so only the custom **coin** and **Prisma** server emojis remain beside amounts.
- **Developer commands are prefix-only.** Slash handlers and slash registry entries for dev tools were removed so they do not appear in Discord’s public command list (`dcommxp`, `dreset`, `dticketsetup`, `dapplysetup`, and the dev-only registrations in `slash_registry.rb` such as addcoins/prisma/blacklist/card/premium/backup/syncachievements). Use prefix commands and `b!devhelp` instead.
- `.ruby-version` bumped to **3.4.9** (Ruby 3.4 patch). README tech table updated: **PostgreSQL** (`pg` + `connection_pool`) and **discordrb 3.7.2** (replacing stale SQLite / generic discordrb rows).
- Giveaway scheduler sleeps until the next scheduled end time (with a short cap so newly posted giveaways are picked up) instead of polling Postgres every 10 seconds.
- Premium auto-claim batches per-user daily context into one query and runs daily/calendar/Prisma writes in a single transaction.
- Replaced `Hexchu` Goddess art URL across all banner goddess pools.
- Expanded the VTuber roster by adding a large batch of new characters distributed across Common, Rare, and Legendary tiers.
- Added new Goddess-tier cards across all banners: `baonuki`, `Katoh Eli`, and `Megrocks.exe`.
- Updated Blossom's baonuki card flavor text in gacha/trade/view flows to refer to baonuki as "mom's past life."
- Added mama-focused Blossom flavor lines for interactions involving `baonuki` (summon, buy, givecard, view, and trades).
- Added developer command `b!derase` to globally remove `Kyvrixon` and refund 100 Prisma per removed copy.
- Fixed auto-claim daily so it also increments weekly `daily_claims` challenge progress.
- Removed the now-unused `ACTIVE_TRIVIA` in-memory hash from `data/constants.rb`.
